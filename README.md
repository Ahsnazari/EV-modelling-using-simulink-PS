# EV-modelling-using-simulink-PS
This modified version of the simulation model is based on the work proposed in the following paper: 'Design Approaches and Performance Analysis of Electric Vehicle using MATLAB/Simulink' authored by D. K. Kohar, A. K. Pati, and S. Nanda, presented at the 2023 IEEE International Students' Conference on Electrical, Electronics and Computer Science (SCEECS) in Bhopal, India. All rights pertaining to the original work are reserved by the authors.

From the paper: "In this article, a detailed analysis of the design and simulation are discussed step-by-step approach. The step-by-step approaches will be very much helpful to the designer and researcher to analyze the characteristic of EV under different operating conditions".
